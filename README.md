# TCW Portfolio

Number and name of feature: Lab 05 as a total

Estimate of time needed to complete: 4 hours

Start time: 3pm

Actual time needed to complete: 5 hours

I clearly spent more than 5 hours working on this lab. Five hours is how long it took me to finish the requirements for this lab, but overall I spent about 12 hours working on this. It took some time to implement the animation on the about me page.
